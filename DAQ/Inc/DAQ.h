/**
 * @defgroup CAN_Module CAN Messages Group
 * @brief Encoding/decoding logic for CAN messages.
 *
 * This group contains all defines, enums, structs and functions used in
 * encoding and queuing sensors' readings to be transmitted via the CAN bus.
 * All readings are encoded to `daq_can_msg_t::data`.
 *
 * ## Encoded & Decoding Algorithm
 * To encode messages the following simple, yet effective, algorithm is used:
 * \code
 * daq_can_msg_xyz_t to_encode = {.a = A, .b = B,};
 * daq_can_msg_t msg = {0};
 * msg.data = *((uint64_t*)&to_encode);
 * \endcode
 * And to decode, the opposite is done:
 * \code
 * daq_can_msg_t msg = {0};
 * CAN_Receive(&msg);
 * daq_can_msg_xyz_t decoded = *((daq_can_msg_xyz_t*)&msg.data);
 * \endcode
 * This works by:
 * - Taking the address of the source struct (`to_encode` or `msg.data`).
 * - Casting that pointer to a pointer of the target type (`uint64_t*` or `daq_can_msg_xyz_t*`).
 * - Dereferencing the cast pointer to obtain the packed or unpacked data.
 *
 * @attention
 * - This method assumes a **little-endian** architecture and consistent compiler behavior. It may not be portable across different platforms.
 * - To ensure safe and predictable encoding/decoding, structs **must have a fixed size and layout** matching exactly 8 bytes (the size of `uint64_t`), and
 * that's why `static_assert` is used.
 * - Compilers may add **implicit padding** for alignment, so **manual padding** fields should be added as needed.
 * - Misaligned or differently padded structs will cause incorrect data encoding and decoding, potentially corrupting transmitted data.
